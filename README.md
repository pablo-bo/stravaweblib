  A  client library for the Strava(strava.com -  the social network for
athletes) based on http requests, not Strava Rest API. 
  Why? Because the Strava api does not provide some opportunities, for 
example:  get a list  of the athlete activities or give kudos. This library is designed to solve these issues.

Requirements:
requests
